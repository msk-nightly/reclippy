# ReClippy

ReClip by Avery Gan is a self-hosted, open-source video and audio downloader with a clean web UI. Paste links from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, and 1000+ other sites — download as MP4 or MP3. Run it in a disposable Alpine Linux Container, which is low footprint, quick and inexpensive, or directly as a Python app (given you have flask and yt-dlp installed). Some simple additions/modifications, mostly chosen from the PRs in upstream repository, have been applied to improve user experience. Changed the title to in remembrance of Clippy and a world not too long ago in the past which was far removed from the slippery slop of *Artificial Intelligence*.
